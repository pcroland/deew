//! deew-web: serves the deew GUI frontend over HTTP and runs the deew CLI
//! for it in a pseudo-terminal, streamed over a WebSocket.
//!
//! The frontend (`gui/dist`) is embedded at build time: run `npm run build`
//! in `gui/` before building this crate (the build script fails with a clear
//! message otherwise).
